This is the analysis of the very famous experiment by Robert Millikan where he set out to understand the true nature of light. Three different experiments were conducted to analyze the different characteristics of photons. These experiments utilized a high pressure mercury lamp as the light source for the experiments and emitted a 253.7 nm ultraviolet wavelength.
